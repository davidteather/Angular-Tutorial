Hey there this project was created by me, but by using the youtube tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdf5aTYRW0E). It's a good tutorial if you want to learn the basics of angular. 



If you want to build this site for your own deployment see [this](https://angular.io/guide/deployment) angular article.
